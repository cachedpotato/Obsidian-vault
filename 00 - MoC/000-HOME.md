# Welcome!
Hey! Didn't see you there.

Welcome to my obsidian vault! There isn't much to look at but I hope you enjoy your short stay here.

I wasn't really into proper notetaking, as much as I enjoy learning new stuff on a very surface level I normall:w
y just forget what I've just learned and move on, but one day I thought "you know what? maybe I should really start organizing my notes. It _MIGHT_ come in handy later on.", and here we are.

To those who stopped by, I'm guessing you're already involved in the Obsidian community and/or interested in note taking, but if not, I sincerely ask of you to give it a try. Keeping notes have helped me IMMENSELY in a lot of things.

All of my notes will be in English, but it's not my native language, so there will be parts where the wording is pretty awkward. Hopefully as I keep talking notes my English will become better.

# Map of Contents
Because My notes aren't ordered in a strictly hierarchical manner, it may be a bit hard to navigate through at first. Here are my Map of Content (MoC) for all my interests:
### [[010-Programming Language]]
### [[020-Game Development]]
### [[030-Web Development]]
### [[040-Computer Network]]
### [[050-Statistics]]

There are other MoCs inside my MoC folder, such as Rust that is a sub-section of the Maps above but is still big enough to have its own MoC. These will share the same second digits as the parent MoC (ex: Rust is 011 because it's part of a programming language which is 010), hopefully that'll make things easier to traverse.

There will be a lot more to come, but these are my main interests at the moment. Some of them are only placeholders, but I hope to fill them in soon.
