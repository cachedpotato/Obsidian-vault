- Introductory information on hardware, QC, and data analysis methods

- any _eukaryotic cell_ can be studied with scRNA-seq
- scRNA: captures all RNA within cell (which includes cytoplasm)
- snRNA: captures RNA in the nucleus

scRNA dropout: lack of detection of specific transcripts mainly due to technical problems

Compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq is more complex due to heterogeneity and transcriptional bursts
	mRNA are produced in bursts followed by a brief period of inactivity.

advances in microfluidics and cellular barcoding helped the advancement of scRNA-seq.

full length vs 3'-end counting - tradeoff between cost and detail I guess?

Microbiome: microfluidics (droplet > sequencing)

Combinatorial Indexing > scRNA-seq (nature microbiology)

Plants: cell wall > hardships
