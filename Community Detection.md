# Community Detection
Community detection requires partition of a network into community, or "clusters", of densely connected nodes. However, this is an NP-hard problem, meaning it's computationally intractable. That is not to say efforts of creating algorithms that attempts to find the "best" solution hasn't been made. Below are some of the more popular community detection algorithms:

- [[Louvain Method]]
- [[Leiden Method]]
