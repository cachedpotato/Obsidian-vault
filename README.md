# Welcome!

Hello there,

Welcome to my obsidian vault! It's only been... idk 3 days since I started using this app, but I'm having a lot of fun.

I wasn't really into proper notetaking, as much as I enjoy learning new stuff on a very surface level I normally just forget what I've just learned and move on, but one day I thought "you know what? maybe I should really start organizing my notes. It _MIGHT_ come in handy later on.", and here we are.

My main interests are: 
- Bioinformatics
- Statistics
- Computer Network
- Programming language, right now I want to learn Rust, JS and C#.
- Any and everything related to game production (I want to make at least one game before I die), and yes this includes art and music

Right now there's really nothing to see here, but I hope I can keep taking notes and create a fully-fledged "second-brain" or whatever people call it these days. I have a bad habit of starting something and giving up like a week in, hope that's not the case this time around.

As for making my vault public, well I thought it may keep me from slacking of because there is a _very, very slight_ chance someone might look at my notes. Pressure (whether it be real or just in my head) is my driving force for pretty much everything, so uh yeah.

All of my notes will be in English, but it's not my native language, so there will be parts where the wording is pretty awkward. Hopefully as I keep talking notes my English will become better.

...I don't know how to end this. To those who stopped by, hope you have a great day!
