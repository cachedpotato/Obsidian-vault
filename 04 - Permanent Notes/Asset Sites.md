# Asset Sites
Assets are cool when you make it yourself, but MAN does it take a long time... Why not borrow some of them from other's works?

Make sure to not rely on them too heavily, we want our games to be our own after all, and making assets, as long as it may take, is a CRUCIAL part of the game-making process. Use asset packs for mainly testing purposes and/or for getting inspirations.

Also make sure to check the licenses for each asset packs if you're going to release your game with it.

- opengameart.org
- Unity Asset store (for 2D)
- Unreal Engine Marketplace
