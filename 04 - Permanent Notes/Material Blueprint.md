# Material Blueprint
Material can be thought of as textures we can choose for our objects. For 2D popular choices are `MaskedUnlitSpriteMaterial` and `TranslucentUnlitSpriteMaterial`. For 2D-3D Hybrids, we want the lighting to affect our sprite dynamically, so we may want to use `MaskedLitSpriteMaterial`. There are hundreds of materials to choose from natively, and we can also create our own using the material blueprint.
