# Statistical Hypothesis
In statistics, every conjecture concerning the unknown probability distribution of a collection of [[Random Variable|random variables]] representing the observed data $X$ is called a _statistical hypothesis_. 

## Null Hypothesis
If we were to test just one hypothesis for a given distribution, the null hypothesis is basically the _negative_ version of that. For example, say we have a sample of 100 coin flips, and we got 60 heads and 40 tails. Our hypothesis can be:

> The coin is not a fair coin ($p\neq 0.5$)

Then, the null hypothesis, often denoted as $H0$ or $H_0$, would be:
> The coin is a fair coin ($p=0.5$)

Using the Null Hypothesis, we can do [[Statistical Hypothesis Testing]] To figure out if the hypothesis is true (we can reject the null hypothesis).
