# The 12 Principles of Animation

## 1. Staging
Draw the bare bones building blocks for the animation first, and don't just dive in head-first doing everything all at once.
## 2. Arcs
Actions of most natural living things move in a circular arc. 
## 3. Straight Ahead Vs Pose to Pose
Straight ahead method draws each frame consecutively, whereas Pose to Pose first draws the key frames, then draw connecting frames.
## 4. Slow in VS Slow out
the more frames you have close to the beginning/end, the slower the animation will look at starting/ending point.
Too much of slow in/slow out will make animations look unnatural.
## 5. Squash and Stretch
If something hits the ground or is about to jump etc., stretch it. If something is jumping upwards/falling down etc., Squash it. It's important that you preserve the overall volume of the object. If the object is stretched in the horizontal direction, reduce vertical length, and vice versa.
## 6. Anticipation
Before most action, there is an anticipation. Think of a windup motion of a pitcher before he actually throws the ball.
## 7. Overlap/Follow Through
when an object moves/stops, not all parts of that object will move/stop at the same time. For example, when you jump, at the time of the landing, the hair will float for a bit before returning to its normal position.
## 8. Exaggeration
Making animations exaggerated will make it more pleasing and believable.
## 9. Timing
Even if it's the same action, the timing/speed will differ depending on the type of the object. For example, a wooden box will move faster than a steel box. 
## 10. Appeal
Consider adding cool (but not too distracting) background/extra stuff for aesthetics/appeal.
## 11. Solid Drawing
Having a solid understanding of drawing will help draw animations (duh)
## 12. Secondary action
A secondary action is a complementary action for the primary action. This can include a variety of things such as facial expression, head bobbing, weeping, etc.
