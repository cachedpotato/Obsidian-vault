# Structs in C and C++
While C++ is the "Objected Oriented Approach" applied to C, that does not mean C does not even have structs. It does, but with limitations. The syntax is also different as well.

1) C
``` c
typedef struct {
	int age;
	char name[];
}person;
```

2) C++
```C++
struct {
	int age;
	string name;
} person;
```
