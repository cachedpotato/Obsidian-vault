# Paper2D
Paper2D is an Unreal Engine native plugin for 2D game development. It provides us with 4 elements:
- Paper Flipbook
- Sprite
- Tile Map
- Tile Set

## Paper Flipbook
A Collection of images to create animation, just like the name suggests. 
## Sprite
Asset that allows us to display 2D images in the game world
## Tile Set
Set of tiles that's been extracted from a texture or a [[Sprite Sheets |sprite sheet]]. 
## Tile Map
Uses 2D grid and the Tile set as the paint to create levels.



## Animations
Paper 2D does not have animation graphs out-of-the-box, so switching between flipbooks may be a bit cumbersome. With some help with external plugins such as `PaperZD`, however, we can make things a bit easier.
