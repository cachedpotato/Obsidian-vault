# Basic Animation Flow

## 1. Reference
Most of the time you can find reference of what you're trying to draw. You want to draw someone throwing a baseball? Watch MLB clips. Wanna draw someone gobble down 10 pound burger? Hey food fighting is a thing.
If you can't find the perfect reference that satisfies all your needs, maybe try creating one yourself. 
## 2. Breaking things down
Say you want to draw someone swinging an axe. If drawing everything all at once seem too overwhelming, break things down into parts. For animals/humans you can maybe split them into head/upper body/lower body/arms. This should make things a lot more manageable.

## 3. Key Poses
Key poses will probably include: Start, Anticipation, Follow Through, End frame, and a bit more depending on what you draw.

### 3.1 Smear Frames
For fast motions where you'll only draw 1-2 frames for, It can be useful to use smear frames. Basically, connect/merge several frames worth of drawing into one. Here is one example:

Smear frames do look weird, but in the context of the entire animation, these add fluidity and are an essential part of animation.
## 4. Timing
Manage speed/overall flow the animation. How fast should it be? Should it get progressively faster/slower? How fast/slow should anticipation/follow through be? Think about the context of the animation
## 5. Secondary Animation
Besides the primary animation (whether it be swinging, throwing, etc.), there are also other elements to animation called secondary animation. These are stuff that move rather independently, but will complement and give more context to the primary animation, like hair movement, facial expression. etc.
