# Tile Maps
Tiles are what levels are comprised of in traditional 2D games. Think of tile as the smallest (practical) element of the level. Often times, each tile has an ID assigned to differentiate their appearance or behavior. Of course, the concept of tiles is not limited to 2D games and can be extended to 3D games as well.

Below is a classic example of a tile map.

Just like [[Sprite Sheets]], we can access and put tiles using quads, though most game engines splices the quads for us and gives us brush tools for easy level design.
