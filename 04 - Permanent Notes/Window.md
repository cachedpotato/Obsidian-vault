A window is the _visible_ part of the _document_, which is the entirety of our webpage. Think of a REALLY long Wikipedia page for example. We cannot fit all that text into our monitor at once, unless we zoom the hell out. Normally, we would have only a portion of the entire page visible, like the diagram below:
